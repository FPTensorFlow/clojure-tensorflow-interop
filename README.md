# How to run TensorFlow native library in Clojure 

This example app shows how you can run TensorFlow's new Java api from inside clojure.

This solution is explained in detail [here](http://kieranbrowne.com/clojure-tensorflow-interop).


## Method 1: Install the system binary

### 1. [Install Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)

```sh
$ brew install maven
```

### 2. Download TensorFlow jar
```sh
$ curl -O https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/libtensorflow/libtensorflow-1.0.0-PREVIEW1.jar
```

### 3. Download the appropriate Tensor Flow Native library for your system

```sh
$ TF_TYPE="cpu" && OS=$(uname -s | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]') && mkdir -p ./jni && curl -L "https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/libtensorflow/libtensorflow_jni-${TF_TYPE}-${OS}-x86_64-1.0.0-PREVIEW1.tar.gz" | tar -xz -C ./jni
```

### 4. Use Maven to install the library locally
```sh
$ mvn install:install-file \
		-Durl=file:repo \
		-DgroupId=org.tensorflow \
		-DartifactId=libtensorflow \
		-Dversion=1.0.1 \
		-Dpackaging=jar \
		-Dfile=libtensorflow-1.0.0-PREVIEW1.jar \
```

## Method 2: Build from source

TensorFlow's java api is in active development with changes and improvments added every other day. By building from source, you have access to the latest changes to TensorFlow as they are added. This method of course takes much longer.

### 1. Install cli tools
1. [Install Bazel](https://www.bazel.build/versions/master/docs/install.html)
2. [Install Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
3. [Install Swig](http://www.swig.org/Doc3.0/Preface.html)

If you use homebrew, just `brew install maven bazel swig`. I also had to `brew upgrade bazel` due to compatibility issues.

### 2. Clone TensorFlow

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:tensorflow/tensorflow.git
$ cd tensorflow
```

### 3. Configure the build

```sh
$ ./configure
```
You will be prompted with various questions about your build. If you have a CUDA graphics card definitely say yes to the gpu options.

### 4. Build TensorFlow

It's probably a good idea to put the kettle on for this one. It took about 20 minutes on my MacBook pro.

```sh
$ bazel build -c opt //tensorflow/java:pom
```

### 5. Add to your local maven repository
```sh
$ mvn install:install-file \
      -Dfile=bazel-bin/tensorflow/java/libtensorflow.jar \
      -DpomFile=bazel-bin/tensorflow/java/pom.xml
```
